/////////////////////

v3.2.2
	- It is now possible to choose between a new method of blending tiled textures.
	- The support scheme for mipmaps in textures within the atlas has been improved for greater
	  compatibility and performance.
	- Skinned Mesh Combiner now has 3 methods of blending tiled textures. The skip all method,
	  the legacy method and the improved method. The improved method fully supports the blending
	  of tiled textures, even if the value of the vertices in the UV map is negative.
	- The UV mapping algorithm of the All In One blending method has been rewritten for compatibility
	  with tiled textures.
	- The merging progress bars now have a new progress algorithm that actually displays the progress made.
	- The documentation has been updated to reflect the changes.
	- Some bugs have been fixed.
	- Skinned Mesh Combiner can now correct the resolution of all your textures, automatically to avoid
	  problems with UV mapping and texture positioning.
	- Skinned Mesh Combiner will now always show a warning of difference in texture resolution.
	- The merging of meshes that do not have all vertices mapped in the UV has also been improved.
	- A small change in the API was necessary. Only the variable "MergeTiledTextures" has undergone
	  a change in its type. Rather than being a Boolean variable, it is now an enum variable so that
	  it is possible to select the tiled texture merging algorithm.
	- Memory consumption by merging the All In One method was further reduced.
	- The merging speed of the All In One method is now even faster.

v3.1.2
	- A bug has been fixed that caused the automatic deactivation of some scripts' Gizmos to stop working.

v3.1.1
	- Fixed a bug where changing Skinned Mesh Combiner UI parameters did not work on some versions
	  of Unity 2019.3.x.
	- The Skinned Mesh Combiner now displays the property currently in use to locate Main Textures
	  (in Built-in RP, URP, HDRP and LWRP), if you leave the "Default Property of Main Textures"
	  option checked. You can even define a custom property for SMC to look for textures in your
	  materials.
	- Automatic detection of the RP currently in use has been improved for a little more accuracy
	  and responsiveness.

v3.1.0
	- Skinned Mesh Combiner can now detect if you are using an SRP that is not the Unity standard.
	  Thus, the SMC will know what the default properties of each SRP are.
	- Fixed a bug where instantiating the Skinned Mesh Combiner component at run time, and trying
	  to change some merge parameters, caused errors.
	- Now calling the "SkinnedMeshCombiner.GetCombinedMeshSkinnedMeshRenderer()" function while
	  the meshes are not combined will cause the SMC to combine them automatically, so the
	  Skinned Mesh Renderer resulting from the merge will be returned.
	- Now the "CombinedMeshesManager" components included in the meshes resulting from the merge,
	  will include a matrix containing all the Skinned Mesh Renderers used to generate that combined mesh.
	  It will be possible to access this matrix through the following variable: CombinedMeshesManager.sourceMeshes;
	- The documentation has been updated!

v3.0.1
	- This is yet another major update to the Skinned Mesh Combiner. In this update the code is being
	  improved in several aspects, besides that, several improvements were made and several new
	  features were brought! It's been over 1 year since the first version of the Skinned Mesh
	  Combiner was released, and nothing better than a major update, to celebrate that!
	- BE AWARE: Upgrading to this version will bring several improvements to your project's Skinned
	  Mesh Combiner, however, several API functions and variables have been changed and your scripts
	  that access the Skinned Mesh Combiner will need to be edited to correct possible reference
	  problems. If you want to upgrade to this version of Skinned Mesh Combiner, please make a backup 
	  of your project!
	- The included materials have been removed from the asset, you must now provide a material to be
	  used by the combined mesh after the merge is done. This will improve your workflow and give you
	  more freedom to manage your materials.
	- The detection of Anima2D in your project has been improved a little too.
	- Some changes were made to the Skinned Mesh Combiner Interface, in order to improve the workflow
	  and facilitate the understanding and use of the tool.
	- Several of the variables were renamed, deleted or had their functions modified in the Skinned
	  Mesh Combiner. Despite this, everything will continue to work the way it always has, you will
	  only need to correct your references in your scripts (only if you access them through your scripts).
	- Skinned Mesh Combiner can now call an event that will execute its registered methods, when
	  performing a merge, or undo a merge! This is useful for your script to know when the merge has
	  completed, or has been undone!
	- Skinned Mesh Combiner can now identify textures without the "Read/Write" option enabled,
	  so it can show you which textures are having this problem, and allow you to have everything corrected.
	- It is now possible to combine the meshes automatically, right at the start of the game.
	- The entire code was rewritten, aiming at better performance, clarity, modulation, organization
	  and several improvements.
	- Minor improvements to UI descriptions.
	- Minor additions to the asset menu.
	- Improvement of some asset codes.
	- Improvements to undo actions.
	- Fixed a bug when importing this asset for the first time, where a file error message was displayed.
	  It was more common with Windows 10 users.
	- There was a slight change in the asset API. Now, to access the API methods of this asset,
	  use "using MTAssets.SkinnedMeshCombiner".
	- Now, it is no longer necessary to activate the execution of the Garbage Collector through the
	  variables of a Skinned Mesh Combiner component. From this version on, you only need to inform
	  if you want to run the garbage collectors, when you call the unmerge method!
	- Skinned Mesh Combiner now has a debugger to which you can view all meshes, textures and other
	  features that have been found and will be combined by SMC! This makes your debugging work easier
	  and gives you more freedom so you know exactly what will be merged and what will not be merged!
	- Some merge parameters have been removed, as they are rarely or never used, and this will make the
	  code simpler, in addition to taking up less space in the Skinned Mesh Combiner component in the Inspector.
	- The Skinned Mesh Combiner can now automatically identify whether the mesh resulting from the merge will
	  have a 32-bit or 16-bit index. Therefore, you no longer need to check any options to allow meshes
	  over 64,000 vertices to be merged.
	- Now, in the "One Mesh Per Material" method, after merging, all meshes will be combined in just 1 final
	  mesh, which will have all the necessary materials, instead of the old method, where 1 mesh was created
	  for each GameObject.
	- Now, the combined mesh files are saved in another directory, outside the asset folder, so if you need
	  to remove the asset, or reinstall it, you will not lose your merges!
	- Now, when undoing a merge of a GameObject that is a prefab, it will not break its copies.
	- Now the statistics display is more functional and detailed, showing resources generated during the merge,
	  for example!
	- The "Enable Advanced Atlas" option has been removed. Now the Skinned Mesh Combiner is smart enough to
	  combine all textures in the best possible way within an atlas, delivering the best possible quality.
	  While supporting map effects like Normal Map, Height Map and etc.
	- Fixed a bug that caused the meshes to be disabled, but the GameObject to be enabled, to be combined.
	- It is now possible to change and choose where the Skinned Mesh Combiner will find the main texture of
	  your material. The main texture is the texture that normally stores your character's texture and in
	  some shaders the property that stores it may be different.
	- Merging compatibility with Mixamo models has been improved!
	- Now, the export of textures is done after combining the meshes of your character and has a new
	  interface for this.
	- It is now possible to choose the size of the edges that each texture will have when it is packaged
	  in an atlas. This will give you the power to choose how much detail you want to gain in your atlas
	  textures, while losing in mipmaps, and vice versa.
	- You can now choose the spacing between each texture, in the atlas generated during the merge.
	- It is now possible to add 2 or more Skinned Mesh Combiner components to a single character. This will
	  make it possible to combine LODS for example! To combine LODS now, you only need to add more than 1
	  Skinned Mesh Combiner component and configure each component to ignore the non-LODS meshes you want
	  to combine!
	- It is now possible to choose a name for the GameObject resulting from the merge.
	- Fixed a bug that caused Normal Map atlases to have a Pink/Orange color scale. The correction of normal
	  maps textures with shades of pink / orange will be carried out during the merge, if you leave the
	  option "Pink Normal Maps Fix" enabled. If any unexpected color appears during the normal map
	  blending process, just disable this option!
	- Now, the processing time for textures (copies, atlas creation, etc.) has been considerably reduced!
	  This makes the "All In One" blending method more feasible in several cases!
	- Now the Skinned Mesh Combiner will check all the textures that will be merged and will inform you if
	  any texture is different in size from the others. This will help you remember to leave textures and
	  maps of the same size toads, to ensure perfection when merging textures into an atlas.
	- Skinned Mesh Combiner now knows how to handle better when it doesn't find any texture or map, so the
	  amount of artifacts generated when not finding a texture or map is considerably reduced.
	- Skinned Mesh Combiner can now work much faster and with MUCH bigger textures! 8k textures are now
	  processed easily and MUCH faster.
	- Skinned Mesh Combiner now also supports DetailMask.
	- Now when combining meshes that use only colors in the material, with the "Just Material Colors"
	  method, you can manually choose the property that stores the colors of your materials!
	- Combined meshes now carry a mesh management component. This will make the Skinned Mesh Combiner
	  management and monitoring work easier, as well as making things cleaner.
	- Added the Skinned Mesh Bones Manager component. With this component you can view and manage the bones
	  of a Skinned Mesh Renderer. It is extremely useful for debugging, and provides the possibility to make
	  your Skinned Mesh Renderer use the bone hierarchy of another SMR. It also offers APIs for use in real
	  time, and has a great interface for you to use it in the Editor! A good example of this. If you have
	  a naked character and you want your clothes to use the same hierarchy of bones that the body is
	  already using and animating, you can use this component to do this, both in the Editor and at run time!
	- Now the Gizmos of the SkinnedMeshCombiner and other components are no longer displayed.
	- The Skinned Mesh Combiner API now offers a method for you to transform the mesh resulting from the
	  merge into a static mesh, that is, a mesh with Mesh Rendere and Mesh Filter. This can help a lot with
	  optimizations! You can also undo this conversion and bring the dynamic mesh (Skinned Mesh Renderer)
	  back to life, the way it was before. All of this is possible while the game is running.
	- Another new feature for merging meshes generated with Anima2D! You can now have a window called
	  "Layers Ordener" to order which meshes will appear above others after merging. To access this function,
	  just click on the button that appears in the Skinned Mesh Combiner component while you have selected
	  the "Only Anima2D Meshes" blending method!
	- Now, by default, the option to launch debug logs on the console, is enabled so that in case of any
	  runtime merging error, you know. You can always disable it if you prefer!
	- The documentation has been completely updated to accommodate all new changes!

v2.2.3
	- Fixed a problem importing the asset.

v2.2.1
	- Now, when combining meshes of Anima2D characters, an atlas will be generated!
	- More functions have been added to the "Only Anima2D Meshes" merge mode.
	- Fixed bugs with the Anima2D merge
	- Updated documentation
	- The combined mesh render script has been improved.
	- Now it is possible to export in PNG the atlas generated during the merge of Anima2D meshes.
	- You can now view the atlas generated during the merge of Anima2D meshes in the "Stats" tab.

v2.1.1
	- Small housekeeping in scripts
	- Fix a bug with welcome messages

v2.1.0
	- Small improvements in the descriptions of each component option in the Inspector.
	- Now the Skinned Mesh Combiner has full support for Anima2D from Unity Technologies. The Skinned Mesh Combiner now recognizes
	  and can work side-by-side with the Anima2D tool.
	- Added new merge method: "Only Anima2D Meshes". This is a merge method that only combines skinned meshes generated by the Anima2D tool 
	  from Unity Technologies! Now you can combine your skinned meshes generated from sprites (from Anima2D) using the Skinned Mesh Combiner MT
	  and enjoy the features of both tools!
	- Updated documentation with the new features!

v2.0.1
	- Made minor improvements to the code.

v2.0
	- Added option to save atlas files with encoding and PNG format.
	- Added full support for Specular Maps.
	- Added full support for Metallic Maps.
	- Added two new integrated shaders: Standard Specular and Standard Specular Culling Off.

v1.9
	- Fix of small bugs.
	- Small adjustments to the tool.
	- Added the "Logs of Merge" tab (in the "Skinned Mesh Combiner" component interface). Now you can see all the logs
	  that the Skinned Mesh Combiner emits through the Inspector. So you do not have to look for logs on the Unity console, you can see each separate log.

v1.8
	- Improvements in the organization of the source code.
	- Added full support for Normal Maps!
	- Added two more pre-created shaders to the Skinned Mesh Combiner!
	- Minor bug fixes!
	- Added a new algorithm for processing atlas, to give full support to effects like Normal Maps! (For All In One method)
	- Added options so you can configure the final material generated by the merge in the "All In One" method.
	- The All In One method was developed from the beginning, with the to merge meshes that use textures. To improve the
	  efficiency of this merge method, now each material must have a main texture associated with it. The mesh that has a
	  material with no main texture will be ignored.
	- Added option to automatically generate prefab after merge.
	- Added full support for Secondary Normal Maps!
	- Added full support for Height Maps!
	- The Skinned Mesh Combiner component now has a tab that displays the merge statistics, and atlases generated after merge.
	- Merge statistics are now always automatically generated when combined using the Editor. These statistics will be displayed
	  in the "Stats" tab of the "Skinned Mesh Combiner" component.
	- Added full support for Occlusion Maps!
	- Added full support for Detail Albedo Maps!
	- Added full support for Detail Albedo Maps!
	- Added a new merge method! "Just Material Colors". This new merge method, just does the job of combining all the colors of
	  your materials, into an atlas image. Perfect for people who do not use textures in their materials, just colors.
	- Documentation updated and improved even more!
	- In-editor merge management has been improved.
	- Now you can also see a preview of how the atlas was generated after the merge, through the "Stats" tab.

	- One of the most powerful updates of the Skinned Mesh Combiner!
	- Fixed a compatibility problem in the "All In One" method that incorrectly mapped the atlas in the merged model.
	- Improvements in compatibility with newer versions of the Unity Engine.
	- Bug fixes.
	- Merge processing time of the "All In One" method has been reduced by up to 30%.
	- The documentation has been updated!
	- The 65,000 vertices limitation has been removed. Now you no longer have to worry if your merged model will grow to 65,000 vertices!
	- The minimum support version is now Unity 2018.1.0f2. This change was made to ensure future improvements to the tool!
	- More is to come. Stay tuned!

v1.6
	- This update has brought a lot of minor improvements.
	- Bug fixes on newer versions of Unity Engine.
	- The next versions will bring great improvements to the Skinned Mesh Combiner MT. Get ready!

v1.5
	- Added an option to improve compatibility between the various model formats (.fbx, .blend, and many others).
	- Now when you combine meshes and choose to save the data in your project, the previous data will not be overwritten.
	  Now you can continue to create your prefabs, but without any fear of losing the old data!
	- Now, when you undo the merge (using the editor), the data saved in your project will also be deleted
	  (if you have enabled saving data in assets). This will prevent useless files from consuming disk space on your project!
	- The component now detects when you are missing important merge files and warns you (if you have enabled the option
	  to save the merge files in your project).
	- Documentation has been enhanced with the new features! Enjoy!

v1.4
	- The demo scene has been enhanced to better exemplify the merge API at runtime. To view the demonstration,
	  start the simulation of the scene and use the buttons. You can see the script on the Canvas to study it
	- Added some more details in the documentation
	- Small optimizations
	- Fixed bug when building game with tool
	- Fixing small bugs

v1.3
	- The asset art has been redefined for some improvements.
	- A small improvement in post merge statistics has been made. You can now see the optimization rate after the merge.

v0.2
	- Added a protection mechanism and notification for incompatibility, during the merge of meshes using
	  different root bones.
	- The documentation will now include the current version of the asset in the title.
