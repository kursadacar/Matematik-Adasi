                </div>
                The Skinned Mesh Combiner is a tool that will help you merge the meshes that use the Skinned Mesh
                Renderer.
                The Skinned Mesh Combiner only works with this type of mesh. The Skinned Mesh Combiner has some merging
                methods,
                each method has its positive and negative sides, you can see this below in the documentation. See the
                video
                demo below and follow the reduction of draw calls with each type of merge.

                    First steps to combine
                </div>
                Before you begin to merge your meshes, you must first prepare the entire GameObjects hierarchy and
                properly
                validate Skinned Mesh Renderers.
                <br />
                <br />
                <b>Step 1</b> - Your hierarchy of Skinned Meshes should be as shown in the image below. For example, if
                you
                want to combine a character, your meshes must be organized the way you explain the image below...
                <div class="image">
                    <center>
                        <img src="Files/Images/1.png" />
                        <br />
                        "Character GameObject" must have the Animator that will be responsible for executing the
                        animations
                        of its Skinned Meshes. The Skinned Mesh Combiner should be in the Root GameObject (Character),
                        because when you start the merge, the Skinned Mesh Combiner will search for all the Skinned
                        Mesh affiliated with it. Each GameObject "SkinnedMeshX" image contains a Skinned Mesh Renderer.
                    </center>
                </div>
                <b>Step 2</b> - Make sure all of your meshes have materials associated with them. Meshes that have empty
                materials will be ignored during the merge.
                <div class="image">
                    <center>
                        <img src="Files/Images/2.png" />
                        <br />
                        Avoid leaving null materials on Skinned Mesh Renderers. This also helps with optimization.
                    </center>
                </div>
                <b>Step 3</b> - Prevent your Skinned Mesh Renderers from having null meshes, as any Skinned Mesh
                Renderer
                that has null meshes will be ignored during the merge process.
                <div class="image">
                    <center>
                        <img src="Files/Images/2a.png" />
                        <br />
                    </center>
                </div>
                <b>Step 4</b> - Make sure that all the materials that your meshes use have Main Textures. This is not an
                obligation, and depends on the merging mode, but it may be good to have textures associated with all
                materials.
                <br />
                <br />
                <b>Step 5</b> - Now that everything is ready, it's just you to combine the meshes! For this, keep
                reading.

                    How to combine meshes (In Editor)
                </div>
                To combine meshes using the editor, it's very simple and easy! Let's go step by step. With this method,
                you
                will not need to use any line of code, and in addition, when the scene starts your meshes will already
                be
                combined!
                <br />
                <br />
                <b>Step 1</b> - Add the "Skinned Mesh Combiner" component to the root GameObject of your skinned meshes.
                <div class="image">
                    <center>
                        <img src="Files/Images/3.png" />
                        <br />
                        Select the root GameObject for your model. Then click "Add Component." Search for "Skinned Mesh
                        Combiner". Then just add the component that appears in the image above.
                    </center>
                </div>
                <b>Step 2</b> - Select the Merge Method. Each merge method has advantages and disadvantages, and each
                one
                meshes the meshes in a different way. We'll talk about the merge methods below in the documentation.
                <div class="image">
                    <center>
                        <img src="Files/Images/4.png" />
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Just click on the "Merge Method" box and choose one of the options. (<b>
                            <font style="color: #ce0000;">Some merge methods will provide you with a variable called
                                "Material To Use".</font>
                        </b> You must provide a material to be used by the mesh resulting from the merge. Skinned Mesh
                        Combiner will apply the material you supply, that is, a copy of the material you supply, and
                        will
                        apply it to the combined mesh.)
                    </center>
                </div>
                <b>Step 3</b> - Click the "Combine Meshes!" Button.
                <div class="image">
                    <center>
                        <img src="Files/Images/5.png" />
                        <br />
                        Notice: The merge process varies according to the method chosen, the number of vertices that the
                        meshes have, and the size of their textures.
                    </center>
                </div>
                <b>Step 4</b> - Wait a few moments and when the "Combine Meshes!" switching to "Undo Merge" means that
                the
                meshes were combined! After combining, new meshes will be generated and old
                meshes will be deactivated. You can always disable the merge whenever you want!
                <br><br>
                Automatically, the Skinned Mesh Combiner will also show you the "Logs Of Merge" tab that contains all
                messages generated by the Skinned Mesh Combiner while the merge was being performed. This is how the
                Skinned
                Mesh Combiner communicates with you, in case you find something wrong, or think it's important to let
                you
                know!

                    How to combine meshes (At Runtime)
                </div>
                It's also easy to combine meshes while your game runs! However, avoid combining meshes repeatedly in a
                short
                time, this can lead to a high memory expense, and depending on the merge method, can cause freezes in
                your
                game. Then use this function with caution.
                Currently, the best method of merge at runtime is the "One Mesh Per Material". You can read about all
                the
                methods below in the documentation. Then follow the steps below to merge at run time.
                <br />
                <br />
                <b>Step 1</b> - First, import the "MTAssets" library into your script, because without it you will not
                be
                able to access the classes of this tool.
                <div class="script">
                    <center>Script C#<br /><br /></center>
                    <pre><code class="language-csharp">
using MTAssets.SkinnedMeshCombiner;
</code></pre>
                </div>
                <b>Step 2</b> - Find the root GameObject that has the "Skinned Mesh Combiner" component. Then get the
                "Skinned Mesh Combiner" component. See an example below.
                <div class="script">
                    <center>Script C#<br /><br /></center>
                    <pre><code class="language-csharp">
void Start()
{
    SkinnedMeshCombiner combiner = RootGameObject.GetComponent&ltSkinnedMeshCombiner&gt();
}
</code></pre>
                </div>
                <b>Step 3</b> - Then call the "CombineMeshes()" method of the Skinned Mesh Combiner. When you call this
                method, the merge will start instantly. The merge method to be used will be what is defined in the
                Skinned
                Mesh Combiner component at the time of calling this function.

    combiner.CombineMeshes();
}

                </div>
                - If you want to see if your meshes are currently merged, see the method "isMeshesCombined()".
                <div class="script">
                    <center>Script C#<br /><br /></center>

    if(combiner.isMeshesCombined() == true)
    {
        //Do something
    }
}
</code></pre>
                </div>
                - If you want to undo the merge, just call the "UndoCombineMeshes(true, true)" function.

                    How this method works (One Mesh Per Material Merge Method)
                </div>
                Briefly speaking, the "One Mesh Per Material" method combines all meshes that share the same material
                into
                one. So if you have 5 meshes that use material A, those 5 meshes will be combined in 1 mesh, which will
                use
                this material A. I will explain more precisely below.
                <br />
                <br />
                First the Skinned Mesh Combiner looks for the Skinned Meshes that are the childrens of the GameObject in
                which it is. Then, the Skinned Mesh Combiner groups meshes that use the same material. When you have a
                mesh
                that uses more than 1 material, the Skinned Mesh
                Combiner will separate the faces of this mesh according to each material.
                <div class="image">
                    <center>
                        <img src="Files/Images/6.png" />
                        <br />
                        Each box represents a GameObject containing the Skinned Mesh Renderer. Green boxes use material
                        A,
                        blue boxes use material B and brown boxes use material C.
                    </center>
                </div>
                After separating each mesh, it creates a new GameObject. This new GameObject will group the new meshes
                resulting from the merge.
                <div class="image">
                    <center>
                        <img src="Files/Images/7.png" />
                        <br />
                    </center>

                Then after that, the Skinned Mesh Combiner will combine all the meshes and submeshes that share the same
                material, and insert all into a one mesh inside the GameObject created in past step.

                    How this method works (All In One Merge Method)
                </div>
                Briefly speaking, the "All In One" method will merge all meshes into one, and only one new mesh will be
                generated that will be the junction of all the others. Then it will merge all the textures into one
                atlas,
                and will insert that atlas into a new material. At the end, this material will be inserted into the
                unique
                mesh. With this merge method, all the textures to be merged must have the "Read/Write enabled" option in
                the
                import settings.
                If you have 5 meshes, only 1 mesh, 1 material and 1 atlas will remain after the merge. This method is a
                bit
                more complex, so try to understand well how it works before using it. In addition, this method is not
                compatible with any mesh.
                <br><br>
                <b>Some meshes can offer problems for this method</b>, according to the way in which they were created.
                For
                example, some meshes may contain errors in your UV map, which can generate errors during the merge,
                however,
                <b>the vast majority of the tested meshes did not result in errors during the merge and everything
                    worked
                    perfectly in tests!</b>
                <br />
                <br />
                First, it merges all the meshes together, creating a new mesh that is the junction of all. However, this
                new
                mesh does not have any material.
                <div class="image">

                    </center>
                </div>
                After you provide a custom material (Material To Use), the Skinned Mesh Combiner will copy your material
                when creating the new material. This new created material will be inserted into the created mesh.
                <div class="image">
                    <center>
                        <img src="Files/Images/11.png" />

                    </center>
                </div>
                After this, the Skinned Mesh Combiner will extract the texture of each old mesh and will create an atlas
                texture. It will create atlas textures according to your preferences, being able to create atlas with
                textures, normal maps, occlusion maps and etc.
                <div class="image">

                    </center>
                </div>
                Then the created mesh will have its UVs modified so that it can receive the new atlas. Then the atlas is
                inserted into the new mesh created.
                <div class="image">

                    </center>
                </div>
                Finally, old meshes are disabled. Resting only the mesh created with its material and texture with

                it collects the color of each material that its meshes use, creates an atlas that contains a palette
                of colors for each mesh that was mixed, then color that mesh with its respective color. It is a very
                simple

                    Problems with the drawing order of the Combined Sprites Meshes
                </div>
                Sometimes, by combining the sprites of your characters, you may notice that some sprites are over other
                sprites, an unwanted effect. For example, an arm may lie on top of the body of the character (which
                should
                be behind the body).
                <br />
                <br />
                See the example below.
                <div class="image">
                    <center>
                        <img src="Files/Images/23.png" />
                        <br />
                        In the example, the body remained on the left arm and the neck remained on the face. That was
                        not
                        the expected result.
                    </center>
                </div>
                To correct this, we must change the GameObjects order of each part of the character in the hierarchy and
                this must be done before the merge begins. So we can organize which sprites will be on top of others.
                Knowing this need, the Skinned Mesh Combiner has
                a tool that provides you with an intuitive and easy to understand interface, so you can organize the
                rendering order of your character's meshes, all quickly and in a functional way! After organizing your
                character's meshes with this tool, the same rederization
                order you defined will be used, both after merging, as well as before doing it!
                <br>
                <br>
                In the Skinned Mesh Combiner component, you need to be using the "Only Anima2D Meshes" blending method.
                So
                if the Skinned Mesh Combiner detects meshes to be combined, it will show you the "Set Correct Sprite
                Meshes
                Rendering Order" button.
                Click this button and the mesh rendering order organization interface will appear, so just use the / \
                and \
                / buttons to organize the mesh order. The higher a mesh is at the top, the higher it will be rendered
                over
                the others.

                Anima2D is a tool developed and maintained by Unity Technologies, and like any other tool, it is also
                subject to bugs and flaws. Sometimes, after combining the meshes, you may notice some bugs in the
                meshes,
                but in the vast majority
                of cases the problem is caused by a flaw in the Anima2D scripts. Usually, recreating your character's
                bone
                structure or merging again can solve this problem. Usually the most common bugs are related to the
                rendering
                order of the Sprite
                Meshes after combined. You can always use the tool mentioned in the previous topic. If you need help,

                    delete the meshes</b> after a successful merge,
                because when you undo the merge, the Skinned Mesh Combiner will undo all that has been done and restore

                        The properties of the materials are like "variables" that store a texture. In the example above,
                        the
                        "_BumpMap" property (named Normal Map in Standard material Inspector) stores the normal map

                        effect.
                        That way you won't get lost! By default, Skinned Mesh Combiner will already show you the default
                        property that stores such an effect.

                <b>Step 3</b> - Select the material property you provided (Material To Use) to store the atlas of the

                will be responsible for storing the normal maps atlas that the Skinned Mesh Combiner generates.

                Mesh
                Combiner will look for the variable "_BumpMap" in each shader of each material in your mesh, when the
                Skinned Mesh Combiner finds this variable it will extract the texture of normal map destá variable. When
                it
                has all the
                normal map textures, it will merge them into an atlas.

                variable
                "_BumpMap" in the final material and will insert the normal maps atlas in this variable.

                </div>
                If you have textures and normal maps (or other types of maps like occlusion) and are trying to combine
                using
                the "All In One" method and your textures have different and varied formats, you can end up with
                situations
                where Normap
                Map for example, looks like be positioned incorrectly. As in the example below.
                <div class="image">

                        <img src="Files/Images/26.png" width="600px" />
                        <br />
                        Note that after performing the merge, the normal map seemed more "simplified".
                    </center>
                </div>
                This happened because the textures have a lower resolution than the normal map textures. The textures
                are
                256x256 while the normal maps are 512x512. So Normal maps end up being positioned only in the center of
                the
                texture and there are still some parts of Normal Maps left.

                        <br />
                        Due to the fact that Normal Map is larger than the texture itself, it ends up being poorly
                        positioned over the texture.

                </div>
                To correct this problem simply click on the "Fix all textures where the resolution is different" button.
                Or if you prefer, do it manually, for
                that... Leave ALL the textures and maps of your model, in uniform resolutions. In my
                example model, I fixed this problem by simply resizing all textures, normal maps, occlusion maps and
                etc. to
                the uniform size of 512x512. So in the atlas, all textures will be the same size and the positioning
                will be
                perfect!

                    Edges Mip Map Size Tip
                </div>
                The edges in each texture of an atlas avoid distortions by mip maps, when the camera moves away from the
                3D
                model, or remains at certain angles. The larger the border of each texture, the less chance of artifacts
                appearing. With SMC you have complete
                freedom to select the size of the borders you want to use in the textures of your atlases, and if you
                are
                noticing artifacts in your models, just increase the size of the borders. However, it is important that
                you
                never use borders larger than the textures
                themselves, because, in addition to increasing the time it takes to create the borders, you will also
                cause
                the texture to lose A LOT of quality. See below...

                    Optimization tips for using Skinned Mesh Combiner
                </div>
                <b>Avoid combining meshes multiple times in a short time</b>
                <br />
                Doing this kind of thing can consume too much memory from the heap, and cause performance losses in your
                game. If your game has a customization system for example, just combine the meshes when the player
                finishes
                customizing.
                <br />
                <b>Activate the Unity garbage collection in the Skinned Mesh Combiner settings.</b>
                <br />
                Enabling this setting will cause the Skinned Mesh Combiner to clear the memory used by the data that was
                deleted when you undo the merge. This prevents your heap memory from filling up quickly. Use this option
                with caution as
                this can cause in-game freezes depending on how much data to exclude.
                <br />
                <b>Combining several characters right at the beginning of the scene.</b>
                <br />
                If you need to combine multiple characters (for example, NPCs) early in the game, it may be a bad idea
                to do
                this at run time, since too much memory can be consumed or cause freezes in the game. In these cases,
                give
                preference to
                merge through the Editor (Inspector) so that as soon as the scene is executed the characters will
                already be
                merged. If you prefer, you can enable the "Save Data In Assets" option. When you enable this option,
                whenever you merge meshes using
                the Inspector, data from those meshes will be saved to the files in your project. This makes it even
                easier
                to create pre-merged prefabs!
                <br />
                <b>One Mesh Per Material or Just Material Colors to combine at runtime</b>
                <br />
                The "One Mesh Per Material" and "Just Material Colors" merge method is faster and generates much less
                garbage besides being almost instantaneous, so it's a great merge method to use while your game runs.
                Even
                so, avoid merging many models at the same time,
                or many so-called merge in a short period of time.

                It is not always possible for textures to completely fill the atlas, even if they are perfect squares.
                Textures must have edges (as if they were tiled) in order to be able to support mipmaps with atlas.
                These borders increase
                the size of the textures and often make them no longer perfect squares. Another factor is the varying
                size of the textures or even the spacing between each texture in the atlas (which can be configured in
                the Skinned Mesh Combiner).
                But these are some of the factors that make it not always possible for textures to completely fill the
                atlas. See an example below.

                See below for a good example of a tiled texture that looks stretched or strange after blending.

                We first need to understand why this happens, and for that, we need to know how the options for blending
                tiled textures work. Note that this only happens in "All In One" blending mode. Let's talk about the
                "Merge Tiled Textures" option.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Skip All</b> - The Skinned Mesh Combiner will simply skip any meshes that have tiled textures and
                exclude them from the merge.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Legacy Mode</b> - The Skinned Mesh Combiner will map the UV of tiled textures as if they were any
                other normal textures, this gives the
                impression that the texture is stretched on the mesh, as it is no longer tiled and in fact stretched to
                fit across the
                entire UV of the mesh .
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Improved Mode</b> - The Skinned Mesh Combiner uses a new algorithm that is capable of supporting
                tiled textures, even if the UV coordinates
                of the mesh vertices are negative. The thing here, however, is that the Skinned Mesh Combiner will tile
                these textures
                within the final atlas. If a mesh has a very large tile, the texture will be repeated more and more
                times within the
                atlas, which will end up generating a low quality when the texture is rendered on the mesh.
                <br>
                <br>
                Look at the image above. Note that in the first part the original shape of the texture is displayed. In
                the second part
                the texture seemed stretched because the tiled textures blend mode used was "Legacy Mode". In the third
                part, the
                texture seemed strange because the blend mode used was "Improved Mode" and the mesh of the skirt has a
                huge tile.
                <br>
                See below, in the blender, the UV mapping of the character's skirt mesh.

                        <br />
                        Note that the skirt's UV mapping is much larger than the texture actually is, which generates a
                        large tiling. So, with
                        "Improved Mode" the texture has lost a lot of definition. It was repeated over and over again to
                        the point that there
                        was not so much room to keep repeating while maintaining the definition of the texture.
                    </center>
                </div>
                Now let's make a comparison, with a tiled mesh, but without a huge UV map, so that it is not repeated
                over and over
                again in the final atlas.

                </div>
                Note that this time we use the shirt's mesh as an example. The shirt's mesh uses a tiled texture, but
                the tiling is not
                large when compared to the tiling of the skirt. In the second part of the image above, the texture again
                seemed
                stretched, but this was because the blend mode used was "Legacy Mode". When using "Improved Mode" as
                shown in the third
                part of the image, the result is identical to that of the original texture. This is because the texture
                was also
                repeated in the atlas, but did not lose its quality, because it is not repeated numerous times.
                <br>
                <br>
                Now let's see the shirt mesh UV map.
                <div class="image">
                    <center>
                        <img src="Files/Images/55.png" width="650" />
                        <br />

                    </center>
                </div>
                The UV map of the shirt is large and causes the fabric texture to be repeated several times, but it is
                not as big as the
                UV map of the skirt. Therefore, the texture of the fabric was tiled without loss of quality.
                <br>
                <br>
                In summary ... If you need to match your character but he has a HUGE tile, simply register the mesh that
                has such a
                large tile, to be ignored. For example, I could register my skirt fabric, to be ignored during merging,
                to avoid visual
                problems.
                <br>
                <br>
                If you need to combine tiled meshes, but the tiling is not large (for example, the mesh of this shirt),
                simply use the
                "Improved Mode" and everything will be fine.
                <br>
                <br>
                If you need to match a character that doesn't use any tiled texture, simply use "Legacy Mode". Legacy
                Mode is enabled by
                default, but Improved Mode is recommended in all of your merges.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Tip:</b> Increasing the resolution of the original textures, which will be tiled during merge, can
                increase
                the quality
                of these textures within the atlas after merge.

                    happen?
                </div>
                This is not common. But there is a minuscule chance of this happening, depending on how your model had
                the UV mapped. See the example below to understand
                better.
                <div class="image">

                        In the example blend, the UV mapping of the character's eye was in the wrong place. The texture
                        on the left is the
                        original texture of the character's eye. The texture on the right is the final atlas generated
                        after blending. Note that
                        the texture of the eye in the atlas, had to be partially repeated, because some mesh that also
                        uses this texture, has a
                        tiling.
                    </center>
                </div>
                <b>Explaining what happened:</b> There is some sub-mesh of this character, which uses the same material
                (and
                consequently the
                same texture) as the eye. This sub-mesh has a texture tile, which caused the texture to be partially
                repeated in the
                atlas, and like the texture of the eye, it is together with that circular and white texture, the texture
                of the eye
                ended up being moved too.
                <br>
                <br>
                This was because of the way this character was mapped, perhaps a somewhat incorrect form for merges.
                Unfortunately, it is not possible to predict that this would happen through an algorithm, so the Skinned
                Mesh Combiner
                was unable to apply a correction for this. Everything else in the character model was correctly mapped.
                The eye was only mapped incorrectly because it was in a
                texture that needed to be repeated, thus, shifting its position and leaving the position to which it
                should be.
                <br>
                <br>
                To correct this, first, we can simply use a program like Blender, to separate the vertices of our
                character's eye, as in
                the figure ...
                <div class="image">
                    <center>
                        <img src="Files/Images/57.png" width="650" />
                        <br />
                        Representation
                    </center>
                </div>
                <div class="image">
                    <center>
                        <img src="Files/Images/58.png" width="650" />
                        <br />
                        Don't worry, the Skinned Mesh Combiner will combine all of these fabrics into one.
                    </center>
                </div>
                Now that the vertices of the eye have been separated into a completely new mesh, we just need to create
                a new material
                within Unity, and associate the texture of the eye with this material. Then add the new material, the
                mesh that was
                separated. As shown above.
                <br>
                <br>
                Now that we have done this, there is no other mesh that will use this same material and texture, so the
                texture of the
                eye will not be repeated, moving the pixels of the eye. Therefore, the Skinned Mesh Combiner will not
                repeat the texture
                of the eye and this mesh of the eye will have its own texture within the atlas.
                <div class="image">
                    <center>
                        <img src="Files/Images/59.png" width="650" />
                        <br />
                        This is the result. The eye mesh has now been mapped correctly. All meshes were combined, meshes
                        using tiled texture, had their tiles generated in the atlas, without problems (with
                        Improved Mode) and the eye mesh has its own texture and material, which ended the mapping
                        problem.
                    </center>
                </div>
                <div class="image">

                        <br />
                        This is the atlas generated after merging the character with the fixed problem. The texture
                        marked with a red line, is
                        the duplicated and exclusive texture for the mesh of the eye to which we separate. It was not
                        tiled, as the mesh we
                        separated for the eye, does not use tiled textures, so the Skinned Mesh Combiner did not attempt
                        to repeat such texture.
                    </center>
                </div>
                This process is only useful when you combine meshes using Improved Mode to combine tiled textures and
                the All In One
                blending method. This is not a frequent occurrence, but it is always good for you to be aware and
                understand why it
                happens! In this case, to summarize again, this only happened because they had two parts of the model,
                which were using
                the same texture. A part of the model was using the white circular content of the texture, and that part
                of the model
                was tiling the texture, which caused the pixels of the eyes in the texture to be moved from their
                original location. By
                separating the vertices of the character's eye and creating a new texture just for this separate mesh,
                we solved the
                problem.
                <br>

                That is all!

                URP and HDRP (rendering pipelines) have new default property names in the shaders. For example, in the
                embedded pipeline (Unity default) the default name of the property that stores your character's textures
                is "_MainTex", however,
                in HDRP and URP this default name has been changed to "_BaseMap". Therefore, if you use HDRP, URP
                shaders or different shaders (created by third parties for example), you can change the properties where
                the SMC seeks the textures. To do this,
                deselect the option "Default Main Tex. Prop.", Doing so the Skinned Mesh Combiner will allow you to
                change the default properties where the textures will be searched and applied.

                Sometimes we need to debug our 3D character models, for example, we need to see which vertices are
                controlled by each of our character's bones. Sometimes we need to see all the bones that are part of our
                character's bone hierarchy, and consequently
                which are the bones (Transform) that move and animate our character. When creating a character
                customization system, where each outfit is saved with a different FBX file, we need to make the clothes
                animated using the character's bone hierarchy of bones,
                to ensure perfect animations. The "Skinned Mesh Bones Manager" component provided by the Skinned Mesh
                Renderer can help you with all of this, both in the Editor and at run time. Keep reading to understand

                        to the "Backhair" mesh, and the component will display which vertices of the "Backhair" mesh are
                        affected by the different bones.

                    Making a Mesh Use The Bone Hierarchy of Another Mesh, To Be Animated. Customizable Character,
                    Several FBX Files, One For Each Outfit.
                </div>
                You may have already come across a character customization system. Typically, many games use multiple
                FBX files, a different file for each mesh. In the following example character, the head is the main
                mesh, has its hierarchy of
                bones and the clothes must be attached to it to form the body.
                <div class="image">
                    <center>
                        <img src="Files/Images/42.png" width="650" />
                        <br />
                        It seems that the character has all the meshes together, but it doesn't. Each character's outfit
                        is a different mesh, a different FBX file.
                    </center>
                </div>
                However, note that when I move the bones of the head bone hierarchy, the rest of the body does not move,
                even if I move bones in the spine, arm, etc. This is because each mesh (clothing) of the character,
                still has its own
                hierarchy of bones, and if I want to make the animations of the shirt for example, I need to move the
                bones of the shirt, not move the bones of the head. <b>We are going to use the Skinned Mesh Bones
                    Manager to make all the clothes come alive using the
                    head bone hierarchy, so when we move any bone from the head bone hierarchy, the clothes will also be
                    deformed.</b> Keep reading to learn more!

                    Demonstration.
                </div>
                First, in order for it to be possible for a mesh to be animated using the bone hierarchy of another
                mesh, both must have a hierarchy of identical bones. See the example below, where I show the hierarchy
                of bones of the head, and the shirt.
                <div class="image">
                    <center>
                        <img src="Files/Images/44.png" width="650" />
                        <br />
                        The two meshes have an IDENTICAL bone hierarchy, with the same names, bones in the same indices,
                        etc. To make this possible, when creating my model, I did the following: I created your body,
                        created and placed the bone hierarchy and assigns the weights making the bone
                        hierarchy animate my character's body. So, I created 5 copies of my character's body. In the
                        first copy, I deleted all the vertices of my character's body, leaving only the head. In the
                        second copy I deleted all the vertices of my character, leaving only the vertices
                        pertaining to the shirt, and so on for the remaining 3 copies. In the end, the head, shirt,
                        pants, hair and shoes were left. All using the same bone hierarchy.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        All bones in the bone hierarchy must remain there, in all meshes, even if not all bones are
                        used. For example, in the head, the leg bones, arms, etc. still remain in the hierarchy, but
                        they do not move anything, only the bones of the neck and head make the
                        movement of the head. In the T-shirt, the bones of the legs, head and etc. are still there, but
                        only the bones of the spine, arms and etc. can animate the head.
                    </center>
                </div>
                Just to make things clearer for you, in case you still have doubts: Going to Blender, see the head mesh
                and the shirt mesh, and their respective bone hierarchy.
                <div class="image">
                    <center>
                        <img src="Files/Images/46.png" width="650" />
                        <br />
                        This is the mesh of the head and its hierarchy of bones, in Blender.
                    </center>
                </div>
                <div class="image">
                    <center>
                        <img src="Files/Images/45.png" width="650" />
                        <br />
                        This is the mesh of the Shirt and its hierarchy of bones, in Blender. Note that the two are
                        identical.
                    </center>
                </div>
                Now, at Unity, we are going to make the "Shirt" mesh use the same bone hierarchy as the "Head" mesh,
                using the Skinned Mesh Bones Manager component. See below. Realize that right after the "Shirt" mesh
                starts using the "Head" mesh hierarchy, the "Shirt" already begins to be animated by the bones of the
                "Head" bone hierarchy.
                <div class="video">
                    <center>

                    </center>
                    <br />
                    To do this, I went to the "Skinned Mesh Bones Manager" present in the "Shirt" mesh and then dragged
                    the Skinned Mesh Renderer from the "Head" mesh to the "Bones Hierarchy To Use" field. And then, I
                    just clicked "Use Bones Hierarchy From That Skinned Mesh Renderer".
                </div>
                Now let's repeat the process for all of our character's meshes, so all meshes will be animated by the
                bone hierarchy of our character's head.
                <br>
                <br>
                It is important to note that: The Skinned Mesh Bones Manager will only allow the use of another bone
                hierarchy, if the other bone hierarchy is identical to the bone hierarchy of the current mesh.
                <div class="video">
                    <center>
                        <iframe width="80%" height="310px" class="tscplayer_inline" id="embeddedSmartPlayerInstance"

                    </center>
                    <br />
                    Now our entire character is animated by the hierarchy of bones in the head.
